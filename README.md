This project focuses on developing an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline** for **data preprocessing and transformation** using **Pandas and Scikit-learn**.
The pipeline automates the **extraction of raw data**, handles **data cleaning and feature engineering**, and loads the processed data into a structured format for further analysis or machine learning.  

Key steps include:  
- **Extraction:** Loading data from CSV, JSON, or databases.  
- **Transformation:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalization, and feature selection.  
- **Loading:** Storing the cleaned data in a database or CSV for future use.  
 A well-implemented data pipeline enhances efficiency, reduces manual effort, and enables data-driven decision-making.
